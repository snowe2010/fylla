# Fylla

Fylla, the Norse word for `complete`, is an autocompletion script generator for the [Thor](whatisthor.com) framework.

It currently generates zsh completion scripts, but will soon have support for bash scripts as well. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'fylla'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install fylla

## Usage


```ruby
require 'thor'
require 'fylla' # needs to come before anything that forces Thor configuration
require 'cli' # has code like `class CLI < Thor` which forces Thor configuration

Fylla.load('cli') # must come before `#start()`

CLI.start(ARGV)
```

`Fylla` must be loaded before `Thor.start` is called in order for it to be used.

`require 'fylla'` must be called before any Thor code is accessed _if you would like to use the `completion:` option_. 
If you do not care about using the `completion:` flag in Options, then this requirement does not need to be met. 

General use case will be to create a new subcommand or option that calls `Fylla.zsh_completion(self)`

`Fylla#zsh_completion` returns a string containing the entire zsh completion script, that you can 
use to do what you see fit.

Same for bash completion.

The only requirement for calling `Fylla.zsh_completion(self)` is that `Thor` has loaded all commands/options/etc.

For some examples, you can reference the test folder

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
